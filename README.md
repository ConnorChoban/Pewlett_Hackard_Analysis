# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

Overview of Analysis and Methodology

The purpose of this analysis is to gather data on employees who are nearing retirement so that we can better prepare the organization to replace their positions with new hires. In order to do so, we need to determine who is likely to retire within the next few years, and we do this by filtering our data set by age, and creating a file holding the total number of employees born between 1952-1955. 

The secondary objective of this analysis is to determine which employees are eligible for a new Mentorship program, designed to pass on information from long term workers to new joiners. We do this by looking at employees who were born in 1965, which is ten years later than the final date in the data set created to track employees who may be retiring soon. This way we can ensure that we invest in new employee development as much as possible.
