# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

Note: In the CSV files for this module, the data for employees in the to_date column in several CSVs was interpreted by my computer as '1999-01-01' instead of '9999-01-1'. To avoid any issues with the date, I filtered by '1999-01-01' instead of '9999-01-01' to show current employees. 

## Overview of Analysis and Methodology

The primary objective of this analysis is to gather data on employees who are nearing retirement so that we can better prepare the organization to replace their positions with new hires. In order to do so, we need to determine who is likely to retire within the next few years, and we can do this by filtering our dataset by age, position, and department, and creating a several tables in SQL to easily store and view this information.

The secondary objective of this analysis is to determine which employees are eligible for a new Mentorship program, designed to pass on information from long term workers to new joiners. We do this by looking at employees who were born in 1965, which is ten years later than the final date in the data set created, to track employees who may be retiring soon. This way we can ensure that we invest in new employee development as much as possible.
